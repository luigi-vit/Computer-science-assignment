# Computer-science-assignment
The code is used to make the individual assignment of computer science. The main focus of this assignment is on producing a scalable solution for product duplicate detection.

### How to use the code ###
The code is divided into three parts, which is indicated by the section titles. The first part makes sure that the data is correctly imported. The second section contains all functions needed to execute the code and the third part contains the code that need to be runned to obtain all results. Additionally, there are four code cells in the third part that creates the plots used for visualization of the performance.
